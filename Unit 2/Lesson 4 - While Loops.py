# Example 1 - A program that asks the user for a word until the user enters "please". When the user
# enters "please", the program prints "You know your manners!" and ends

word = ""
while word != "please":
    word = input("Enter a word: ")
print("You know your manners!")

# Example 2 (arithmetic sequence)
x = -492
while x != 834:
    print(x)
    x = x + 13

# Example 3 (geometric sequence)
x = 9
while x <= 9437184:
    print(x)
    x = x*2

# Example 4
x = 3
while x != 786432:
    print(x)
    x = x*-2
